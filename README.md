# tuw-latex-beamer-theme

TU Wien LaTeX beamer theme.


## Installation

    $ make install

However, you don't have to necessarily install the theme:

* You can simply copy the theme, i.e., the `beamerthemeTUW.sty` file and all
  pictures in the `tuw` folder, into the folder where your presentation
  resides.

* You can copy the folder `tuw` from this repo and start preparing your
  presentation `demo.tex`.


## Usage

The beamer theme is accessible via

    \usetheme{TUW}

The beamer theme supports the default outer style "plain", i.e., no sidebar and
simple footer. All other beamer outer themes are also available, although the
color scheme may not fit to the CD of TU Wien for all themes.

Tested outer themes:

    \usetheme{TUW}
    \usetheme[outer=sidebar]{TUW}

You can use [demo.tex](tuw/demo.tex) as a starting point for your presentation.
