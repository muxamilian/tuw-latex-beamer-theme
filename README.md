# tuw-latex-beamer-theme

TU Wien LaTeX beamer theme.


## Installation

    $ make install


## Usage

The beamer theme is accessible via

    \usetheme{TUW}

The beamer theme supports the default outer style "plain", i.e., no sidebar and
simple footer. All other beamer outer themes are also available, although the
color scheme may not fit to the CD of TU Wien for all themes.

Tested outer themes:

    \usetheme{TUW}
    \usetheme[outer=sidebar]{TUW}

You can use [demo.tex](tuw/demo.tex) as a starting point for your presentation.
